            <p class="cell large-8 small-12">The kissing numbers problem asks the question of how many non-overlapping unit spheres can be arranged 
                in space in such a way that they touch a common unit sphere. The answers for the dimensions in which we can percieve, 1d, 2d, 3d, proved
                to be trivial problems solved hundred of years ago. In 1d the kissing number is 2: a line; in 2d the kissing number is 6: a hexagon; and in 
                3d the kissing number is 12: a dodecahedron. It has also been proven that the kissing number is 4d is 24: the 16-cell honeycomb; in 8d it's 240: the E8
                lattice; and in 24d it's 196,560: the leech lattice. The remaining dimensions are unknown, though upper and lower bounds do exist.<br>
                Uses: coding theory, particularly error-correcting codes; computational and discrete geometry; and algorithm and graph theory.

            <p class="cell large-6 small-12">Utilizing discrete object-segmentation and recognition, we were able to develop a model to track the movement of
                objects during a live-scene. In the video, you can see the segmentation work being done to differentiate between unique objects in the scene.
                Current work is being done to track each objects movement-model relative to the camera system to build a robust collision-detection and prediction system.

            <p class="cell large-6 small-12">SLAM odometry, or simultaneous localization and mapping odometry, is the practice of computationally calculating the camera systems
                motion model by comparing the 3d data collected in one "frame" to the 3d data collected in another "frame". You can design an optimization model to calculate
                the camera systems current velocity, accelleration, and rotational intrinsics.<br>
                I very cool outcome of creating a SLAM model, is the ability to collect the computed motion vectors and 3d point data to reconstruct the scene the camera system moved through.
                The video shows the result of a SLAM prototype I built for my internship; the camera system collected continuous data as the camera moved around a bunch of grapes.<br>

            <h2 class="cell text-center">Triangulation Uncertainty</h2>
            <img class="cell large-4 small-12" src="media/uncertainty.png" alt="uncertainty_chessboard">
            <p class="cell large-8 small-12">Computer vision hardware requires a multi-camera setup in order to properly compute the depth, or z-value, of each scanned point.
                An issue that can arise with this, however, is within the precision of the triangulation computation, particularly when the scanned points are physically distant from the camera setup.
                To communicate this possible triangulation error, I worked with my team to implement an uncertainty propogation that utilized the camera intrinsics, point intrinsics, and the 
                jacobian matrix of the projection and reprojection function.<br>
                The results can be seen in the image of the colored chessboard. The color of each point indicates the trace of the uncertainty matrix belonging to that point. Blue indicates low uncertainty, and red indicates high uncertainty.
